/**
 * Metrics collection + JSONL row schema for one arm-run.
 *
 * One run emits a JSONL file: a header `type:"meta"` row, one `type:"turn"` row
 * per LLM call, and a final `type:"summary"` row (row shape mirrors taucode's
 * dogfood-p0 tolerant reader — every numeric field is a plain top-level number so
 * compare.ts can read it without knowing the producer). No conclusions are drawn
 * here; this module only counts and records.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MEASUREMENT TAP POINTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The `context` hook is the single input-side tap: pi fires it on EVERY LLM call
 * with the exact outgoing `messages` payload (after any compaction projection),
 * before the payload reaches the provider. So per-turn INPUT tokens are measured
 * there via pi's own `estimateContextTokens` (reused, never re-invented), and the
 * observer also sees whether the payload was compacted. The mock/real provider's
 * response usage is the output-side tap: OUTPUT tokens come from `usage.output`
 * when present (else an estimate of the assistant text), and cacheRead comes from
 * `usage.cacheRead` (g0-survey Item 5: DeepSeek's `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` maps
 * here). The on-disk session JSONL is the ground-truth transcript used for
 * tool-call / re-read counting.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FORMULAS (documented precisely, applied consistently)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * re_read_count
 *   A `read` tool call whose target path was ALREADY the target of an earlier
 *   `read` in the same run. First read of a path is not a re-read; every later
 *   read of that same path counts +1. Path identity is the exact `path` argument
 *   string (no normalisation) — matches how the extension resolves read paths
 *   from toolCall args (adapter.ts correction #1).
 *
 * compacted_paths
 *   The set of paths whose `read` RESULT was actually compacted (summarised) by
 *   the seam-A hook at least once during the run. A path enters this set the turn
 *   its read result is projected away; it is a property of the run, not of a
 *   single turn.
 *
 * compacted_path_re_reads
 *   Count of `read` tool calls, at ANY later turn, whose target path is in
 *   `compacted_paths`. (A read of a compacted path is counted whether or not that
 *   specific read is itself later a "re-read" — the concern is touching a path the
 *   agent had already been told was summarised.)
 *
 * compacted_path_re_read_rate  ← THE metric that would have caught taucode's
 *   documented false-savings case (aggressive settings: tokens down 47% while
 *   re-reads shot to 124). Defined as:
 *
 *       compacted_path_re_read_rate = compacted_path_re_reads / total_read_calls
 *
 *   i.e. the fraction of ALL read calls in the run that targeted an
 *   already-compacted path. Denominator is total reads (not total re-reads, not
 *   |compacted_paths|) because that is the stable, always-defined base and makes
 *   the rate directly comparable across arms with different read volumes. When
 *   there are zero read calls the rate is `null` (undefined, not 0).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CACHE NULL-vs-0 (g0-survey Item 5)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `usage.cacheRead` is recorded verbatim when the provider populates it. A mock
 * provider that emits no cache signal yields `cache_read_tokens: null` — NOT 0.
 * `null` = "no signal available"; `0` = "confirmed zero cache hits". They are
 * kept distinct so the eventual real-provider analysis is not corrupted.
