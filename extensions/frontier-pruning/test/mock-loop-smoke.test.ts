/**
 * Mock-provider-style loop simulation (task 4).
 *
 * IMPORTANT DEVIATION, reported in full in the completion message: this does
 * NOT import `extensions/deterministic-compaction/src/mock-provider.ts`.
 * Empirically verified (scratch probe, removed after use) that the module
 * cannot load in this package's isolated vitest run at all —
 * `createAssistantMessageEventStream` is imported from `@earendil-works/pi-ai`
 * WITHOUT a `type` prefix, so unlike adapter.ts (100% `import type`, fully
 * erased) it is a real runtime value import. Vite/esbuild correctly keeps it
 * as a live import in the transpiled output, and resolution fails outside
 * pi's own jiti-aliased loading context:
 *
 *   Error: Could not resolve "@earendil-works/pi-ai" imported by
 *   "@taucode/deterministic-compaction". Is it installed?
 *
 * So "reuse mock-provider.ts's scripted mock pattern" is followed in SHAPE
 * (a queue of scripted steps consumed turn-by-turn) using this extension's
 * own already-safe (type-only-import) fixture helpers instead of literally
 * importing that module. Driving a REAL pi agent loop / session and reading
 * back an actual session JSONL file from disk is NOT attempted here — no
 * file in this packet's reading whitelist documents pi's programmatic
 * session-runner API, and pi/ is a forbidden zone. What IS proven below,
 * with real assertions:
 *
 *  1. A growing "canonical transcript" (standing in for session history) is
 *     never mutated in place by the hook, turn over turn — same array
 *     elements, same references, before and after every hook call.
 *  2. Per g0-survey.md Item 3 (CONFIRMED, cited verbatim in this packet's
 *     required reading): pi's real harness treats `transformContext`'s
 *     return as a local variable feeding only the outgoing request, never
 *     `session.append*`/any persistence call. Combined with (1) — this
 *     extension provably never mutates what it's handed, and the harness
 *     provably never persists what this extension hands back — the
 *     conjunction is the on-disk safety property, even without a literal
 *     JSONL readback.
 *  3. The send payload diverges from canonical history once the gate
 *     activates (placeholder appears in the outgoing view only), and
 *     converges back to reference-identical passthrough below it.
