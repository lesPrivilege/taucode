/**
 * V3-WS task 1 — work-semantic anchor block.
 *
 * A deterministic, LLM-free record of "what have I done / where am I" derived
 * ENTIRELY from tool events. When a projection fires (and only then), the anchor
 * block is injected into the volatile send-time tail — the same channel and prefix
 * discipline as the V2-TP stale-view hint (send-time only, never persisted, one
 * block per turn, replacement not append).
 *
 * Motivation (docs/reports/g2-round1-verdict.md): E1-C projected 26 times yet the
 * required `SUBSYSTEM-MAP.md` was never produced — work semantics were lost across
 * projections. The anchor re-states the mechanically verifiable facts the model
 * would otherwise have to reconstruct: files read + hash, edits + diffstat + hash,
 * tests run + result, and pending acceptance targets.
 *
 * Trust discipline (packet 禁区): every line is a mechanically verifiable fact.
 * No evaluative or inferential language ("progress is good", "almost done"). A
 * failed edit is recorded as failed, never dressed up.
 *
 * The hash/diffstat values are computed once in the tool_result wiring (reusing
 * trust-ledger's hashContent/parseDiffstat) and handed in here — this module never
 * re-derives them.
