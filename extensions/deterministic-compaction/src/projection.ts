/**
 * Send-time projection for the `context` hook (seam A).
 *
 * The `context` hook (pi `AgentHarness.transformContext` -> `emitContext`) runs
 * before EVERY LLM call and only affects the outgoing send payload; its return
 * is never persisted (docs/g0-survey.md Item 3). Two properties matter here:
 *
 * 1. Idempotency. `compactCodeProductions` is idempotent by construction (an
 *    already-summarised tool call/result no longer exceeds the size thresholds,
 *    so a second pass is a no-op). We add no state of our own, so running the
 *    projection twice on the same messages yields the same output.
 *
 * 2. Bounded cost. The hook is hot. We reuse pi's own `estimateContextTokens`
 *    for the gate (correction #2 — no bespoke char-count estimator), do a single
 *    O(n) adapter pass, and only invoke compaction past the token threshold. The
 *    whole thing is O(n) in message count with no quadratic scans.
 *
 * Hybrid gating (preserve prefix cache): below `compactAfterInputTokens` the
 * messages are returned UNCHANGED (identity) so the provider prompt prefix is
 * byte-stable and cacheable. Only once the estimated context crosses the
 * threshold do we project — accepting a one-time cache break in exchange for a
 * smaller, cheaper context from then on.
