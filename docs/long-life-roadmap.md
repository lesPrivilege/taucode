# Long Life Roadmap

2026-07-06. This roadmap starts after R2: the project has real DeepSeek data,
artifact retention, deterministic compaction, trust hints, semantic anchors behind
flags, and a first dispatch policy. The goal now is to keep taucode useful after the
current model quirks and job-application window have aged out.

## North Star

> Converged 2026-07-08 (see `program-context-pruning-2026-07-08.md`): taucode is
> a systematic study of context pruning. Advanced harness-side and even
> provider-side pruning mechanisms are replicated as thin-harness extensions
> and measured on one common ledger — cache price, reproducibility class,
> failure fingerprint. The earlier phrasing below still holds; the program
> charter is its sharpened form.

taucode should become a small, durable harness for measuring where context should
be handled by rules, by models, or by provider infrastructure.

The durable asset is not one compaction trick. It is the combination of:

- byte-stable context transforms;
- filesystem-backed provenance;
- provider cache telemetry;
- task-type dispatch rules;
- negative-result discipline;
- artifacts that let humans audit what the agent actually did.

## Product Shape

**Research rig first.** Keep the repository optimized for controlled runs,
reviewable artifacts, and falsifiable reports. Do not turn it into a general
agent framework.

**Plugin second.** Publish the reusable pieces only after the local rig can
explain them: `@taucode/compaction-core`, the pi extension, and a minimal launcher
profile. The plugin should be boring to install and easy to disable.

**Narrative third.** The public story should lead with context quality and
observability. Cost claims are allowed only where paired data and artifact review
support them.

## Horizons

### H0 — Close The Current Loop

- Land the current evidence bundle: `r2-verdict`, evidence index, README, and
  release-path note agree on the same state.
- Run the approved sweep: R1-C at 4k/16k/64k and D1-C at 4k.
- Run E1 x C'' with `TAUCODE_SEMANTIC_ANCHOR=1`.
- Update `note-release-paths.md` from seed to final release decision.
- Open upstream issue candidates only after the evidence pages are stable:
  settings persistence, cache diagnostics, and extension capability gaps.

### H1 — Make The Measurements Boring

- Add a one-command local audit that scans JSONL structure, provider errors,
  flags, manifest hashes, acceptance rows, artifacts, and cache signal presence.
- Promote the R2 turn-interaction retro
  (`docs/reports/r2-turn-interaction-retro-2026-07-06.md`) into the template for
  future post-run analysis: harness action, provider action, failure turn, and
  interaction fix.
- Keep every real run reproducible from a manifest: packet id, arm, threshold,
  workspace hash, provider, model, and env flags.
- Promote artifact review into a standard report section, not an appendix.
- Add golden fixtures for the known failure classes: information gap, summary
  defect, loop pathology, and confirmation spiral.
  (FP-1 landed 2026-07-08: `experiments/lib/fingerprints.ts` + golden fixtures
  from real runs; design & capability matrix in
  `docs/fingerprint-detectors-design-2026-07-08.md`. (a)/(d) full, (c) proxy,
  (b) signal-absent pending schema increment. 参数定档待人裁，结果暂不入报告。)

### H2 — Dispatch Policy

- Turn the R2 strategy table into explicit policy:
  refactor/code-production -> deterministic projection;
  exploration/completion-first -> checkpoint or semantic anchor;
  direct-transform -> baseline unless stronger negative probes fail.
- Test policy decisions on held-out packets before any automatic runtime switch.
- Keep manual override first-class. The policy is a recommendation layer until
  it survives multiple task families.

### H3 — Context Protocols

- Finish semantic anchors as the cheap alternative to checkpoint summaries.
- Evaluate LLM-declared work-semantics sidecars only after C'':
  `docs/reports/llm-declared-work-semantics-2026-07-06.md`.
- Keep the implementation decoupled by extracting semantic events, a unified
  ledger, declaration parsing, projection policy, and renderers:
  `docs/reports/extension-work-semantics-architecture-2026-07-06.md`.
- Add read-summary symbol extraction as a separate packet, limited to TypeScript
  first.
- Evaluate view-based context only when a task shows useful disposable/semantic/
  verbatim intent separation.
- Keep trust hints mechanical: hashes, turns, paths, diffstats. Never inject
  confidence as prose.

### H4 — Provider Contract

- Treat DeepSeek as the primary cache-observable backend.
- Ask providers for cache boundary diagnostics before asking for smarter
  summarization: prefix break offset, cached span ids, and compaction visibility.
- Keep OpenAI-compatible support as a portability check, not the core thesis.
- If server-side compaction appears, compare it as another arm instead of
  rewriting the local thesis around it.

### H5 — Public Release

- Release path A when install friction is low and tests are green from a fresh
  checkout: core package + pi extension + launcher docs.
- Release path B only with bounded language:
  "On refactor/code-production tasks, deterministic projection reached comparable
  acceptance at about one third cost in this n=3 DeepSeek/pi setup."
- Publish failures next to wins. A negative exploration result is part of the
  product: it tells users when not to use the rule.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep `pi/` upstream-zero-diff unless an upstream PR is the explicit task.
- Keep flags default-off for new mechanisms until one controlled run and one
  artifact review pass.
- Do not let ambient dogfooding replace paired experiments.
- Do not let paired experiments replace human artifact review.
- Archive contaminated runs, but never delete them silently.
- Every new metric needs one sentence saying what decision it changes.

## Stop Conditions

- If a mechanism reduces tokens but raises artifact failure rate, it stops.
- If a mechanism wins only under a single prompt shape, it stays experimental.
- If a provider feature makes a local rule obsolete, retire the rule and keep the
  evaluation harness.
- If the harness cannot explain a result from its artifacts, rerun before
  interpreting.
